## **🔍 Quick Debug Steps:**

### **Bước 1: Add BuildingTestScript**
1. Tạo Empty GameObject tên "BuildingTester"
2. Add Component → **BuildingTestScript**

### **Bước 2: Run Debug Tests**
```
Right-click BuildingTestScript:
→ Debug Everything        (check toàn bộ system)
→ Create Test Ground      (tạo ground test + spawn buildings)
→ Test Building Spawn     (force test building spawner)
```

### **Bước 3: Check Debug Results**
Xem Console logs để tìm vấn đề:

**✅ Expected Output:**
```
=== SYSTEM DEBUG ===
BuildingSpawner: ✓
GroundSpawner: ✓
FixedBackgroundManager: ✓
Grounds with 'Ground' tag: 2
  [0] Ground_01: Active=true, GroundMover=true
  [1] Ground_02: Active=true, GroundMover=true
```

**❌ Problem Indicators:**

- `Grounds with 'Ground' tag: 0` → No grounds found
- `GroundSpawner: ✗` → No GroundSpawner
- `Buildings found by name: 0` → Nothing spawned

## **🛠 Common Issues & Fixes:**

### **❌ No BuildingSpawner**
- **Problem**: "BuildingSpawner: ✗"
- **Fix**: Tạo Empty GameObject → Add BuildingSpawner component
- **Setup**: Assign building prefabs trong inspector

### **❌ No Grounds Found**
- **Problem**: "Grounds with 'Ground' tag: 0"
- **Fix**: Right-click BuildingTestScript → "Create Test Ground"
- **Alternative**: Đảm bảo existing grounds có tag "Ground"

### **❌ No Building Prefabs**
- **Problem**: "No building prefabs assigned!"
- **Fix**: Assign prefabs trong BuildingSpawner inspector
- **Location**: BuildingSpawner → Building Assets → Building Prefabs

### **❌ Spawn Chance Too Low**
- **Problem**: "Spawn chance failed"
- **Fix**: Set Spawn Chance = 1.0 (100%) trong BuildingSpawner
- **Location**: BuildingSpawner → Spawn Settings → Spawn Chance

### **❌ Spawning Disabled**
- **Problem**: "Spawning is DISABLED"
- **Fix**: Bật Enable Spawning trong BuildingSpawner inspector
- **Location**: BuildingSpawner → Spawn Settings → Enable Spawning
